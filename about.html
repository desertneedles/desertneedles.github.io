 <p style="text-align:left">All kinds of cactuses flourish in the high and low deserts of Southern California. 
Part of my childhood was spent in Cathedral City, which is located in Coachella Valley. 
I often explored rural trails there with my dogs during weekends and summers. 
Whenever my parents drove through desolate highways in the nearby desert towns, 
I was always on the lookout for the native vegetation and wildlife.</p>

<p style="text-align:left">One particular place I enjoyed visiting back then was The Living Desert in the city of Palm Desert.
There were many nature trails and gardens featuring plants and animals from desert regions all over the world. 
Even though I haven't been back to Cathedral City and/or the Coachella Valley since 1991, 
I hope to visit there again in the near future so I can further my explorations of desert plants and wildlife.</p>
